/===============================================/

You can activate the autosplitter through LiveSplit on Edit Splits, as long as the game is
set to Left 4 Dead 2.

If you don't want to use that option and set this up manually (and I would recommend doing
so), do the following:

-Add a "Scriptable Auto Splitter" component to your layout.
-Select the splitter file
-Adjust the settings as you wish
-Make LiveSplit compare against Game Time (Right-click the timer, go on Compare Against and
choose Game Time)
-Enjoy the autosplitting

Make sure the game is open and you are past the intro cutscenes when you launch LiveSplit. If
you set the splitter up manually, you can just reopen your layout (Open layout -> <Your
layout name here>). If the game crashes, you can still launch the same version and the
splitter will be functional.

The autosplitter generates a fair amount of lag, so reducing graphics settings is advised.
It's also important to note that the splitter has some frames of delay, but it startslate and
ends late, so the time should be correct overall. The run should be retimed manually for a 
precise time.

Q-The splitter doesn't work for me! What do I do? *insert premium despair face here*

A-If the problem you are having is related to autostarting or splitting on finales, that's
normal. Many people in the community mentioned having problems with that. However, I don't
personally have problems with those features, so I don't know how to fix them. You can also
check the "Debug Section" notepad. It will tell you how to fix it by yourself. For the
curious people, the "Debug Section" explains a bit of how the splitter works, but only
vaguely.
