/=================Setting it up=================/
/===============================================/

-Add a "Scriptable Auto Splitter" component to your layout.
-Select the splitter file
-Adjust the settings as you wish
-Make LiveSplit compare against Game Time (Right-click the timer, go on Compare Against and
choose Game Time)
-Enjoy the autosplitting


The autosplitter generates a fair amount of lag, so reducing graphics settings is advised.
It's also important to note that the splitter has about a frame of delay, but it starts a
frame late and ends a frame late, so the time should be correct overall. The run should be 
retimed manually if the time is to close to the end/beginning of a second and it could be a 
tie-breaker.

Q-The splitter doesn't work for me! What do I do? *insert premium despair face here*

A-If the problem you are having is related to autostarting or splitting on finales, that's
normal. Many people in the community mentioned having problems with that. However, I don't
personally have problems with those features, so I don't know how to fix them. You can also
check the "Debug Section" notepad. It will tell you how to fix it by yourself. For the
curious people, the "Debug Section" explains a bit of how the splitter works, but only
vaguely.
