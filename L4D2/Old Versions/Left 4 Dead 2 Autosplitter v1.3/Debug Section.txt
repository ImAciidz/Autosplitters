If you are here, it's probably because you had problems with the splitter or because you are
curious about what was written here.

(Apparently there's a LiveSplit component called ASLVarViewer that I didn't know of by the
time I made this, so I guess you can use that too).

The splitter has the Debug setting on it. With it you can see what values the splitter is
using to take actions. You would need to check the .asl file to see what's relevant to
each situation, so it can be quite a bit of work and requires quite a bit of programming
knowledge. You can check the LiveSplit's AutoSplitter reference if you wanna know more. If
you find what variables aren't changing, you can look for memory values that work for you
yourself. I used Cheat Engine to find these values. It's important to mention that every 
memory address found was a static address (should appear green on Cheat Engine), but if you
find a pointer path that works and is accurate with the variables description, you can use
that just fine. I won't describe how to use Cheat Engine, but there's plenty of tutorials on
the internet. I only used very basic features of Cheat Engine. Below there's a description of
what each variable is and what values said variable has at each moment:

/===============================================/
/===================Variables===================/
/===============================================/

-whatsLoading: a string that seemingly indicates what is loading right now. During a chapter,
this memory value should contain the chapter's name, and during loads, some random object
names. You can just find something that consistently has the level names, but i found this
one better.

-gameLoading: a variable that shows if the game is loading. Should be 1 (or True) whenever
a campaign is loading (the banner is on screen), once the loading symbol shows up on level
transitions and for a couple frames when you die and respawn. It should be 0 (or False) as
soon as previous things disappear from the screen.

-cutscenePlaying1 and 2: a variable that shows if any cutscene is loading (either intro
cutscene or finale cutscene). Should become 1 as soon as the game stops loading a campaign
for the first time (when the banner shows up) and as soon as finales are activated (but the
screen hasn't faded yet). In case of only finding one memory value that behaves like this,
just repeat it for 1 and 2.

-finaleTrigger1 and 2: a variable that shows when the finale gets triggered and the screen
fully fades. Should be 1 when the previous description happens.

-campaignLoading: a variable that indicates if you are loading a campaign (when the banner
is on screen).

-scoreboardLoad1 and 2: variables that indicate whenever the scoreboard appears on screen.
Should be 1 as soon as the scoreboard shows up and should go back to 0 as soon as you take
control again.

-hasControl: a variable that indicates wether you have control over your character or not.
Should be 1 when alive and 0 when you are dead or not in a server.

The following aren't variables referring to memory values but are still relevant to the
splitter:

-startRun: indicates if a run should autostart.

-campaignsCompleted: indicates how many campaigns have been finished. Only matters if the
setting "Split only when the run ends" is active.

-totalCampaignNumber: indicates how long is the run, campaign-wise. Only matters if the
setting "Split only when the run ends" is active.

/===============================================/

Q-I found all these memory values. What do I do with them?

A-Once you find the memory addresses or pointer paths that work, on the "state" sections of
the .asl file, change the addresses for each on the correct game version and you should be
good to go. Again, refer to the LiveSplit's Autosplitter reference to see how to do it
properly.
